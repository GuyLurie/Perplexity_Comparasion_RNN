# Perplexity_Comparasion_RNN
This repository includes an implementation and replication of the "Recurrent Neural Network Regularization" paper by Zaremba et al. (2014). The models are trained and evaluated using the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) dataset. The implemented models are LSTM and GRU, both with and without dropout.
